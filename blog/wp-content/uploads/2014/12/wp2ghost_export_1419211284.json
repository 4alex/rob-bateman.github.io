Mike opened with a fairly decent example of an AIR application that can be downloaded from the site [http:\/\/www.finetune.com\/](http:\/\/www.finetune.com\/ \"finetune\") which is available as a desktop player download for their music library. We need more examples like these!\n\nA few included features for the new release are:\n\n- Native menu support (for mac)\n- Windows toolbar support\n- Support for \u201cView Source\u201d option in the right-click menu.\n- XML descriptor file used to set up variables that are used by the runtime and installer (things such as name, description, systemchrome etc.)\n\nA walkthrough was shown of a demo AIR application that, once compiled, could create and save a simple text file. This was achieved using the File system class extensions for AS3 designed specifically for use with AIR, which are capable of saving any type of data as a file including text, binary and even flash object files (something that might be useful for caching application settings etc.)\n\nAvailable installation options were also a topic of discussion, as AIR is still a relatively new runtime. The application you create requires a core set of files to run, and these need only be downloaded once. Your installer therefore checks the desktop machine to see whether the AIR runtime is already present, and downloads a copy automatically from Adobe if it is required.

Mike opened with a fairly decent example of an AIR application that can be downloaded from the site <a href=\"http:\/\/www.finetune.com\/\" title=\"finetune\">http:\/\/www.finetune.com\/<\/a> which is available as a desktop player download for their music library. We need more examples like these!<\/p>\n<p>A few included features for the new release are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Native menu support (for mac)<\/li>\n<li>Windows toolbar support<\/li>\n<li>Support for &#8220;View Source&#8221; option in the right-click menu.<\/li>\n<li>XML descriptor file used to set up variables that are used by the runtime and installer (things such as name, description, systemchrome etc.)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>A walkthrough was shown of a demo AIR application that, once compiled, could create and save a simple text file. This was achieved using the File system class extensions for AS3 designed specifically for use with AIR, which are capable of saving any type of data as a file including text, binary and even flash object files (something that might be useful for caching application settings etc.)<\/p>\n<p>Available installation options were also a topic of discussion, as AIR is still a relatively new runtime. The application you create requires a core set of files to run, and these need only be downloaded once. Your installer therefore checks the desktop machine to see whether the AIR runtime is already present, and downloads a copy automatically from Adobe if it is required. A new template available from the link below allows for a one click &#8220;badge&#8221; installer (seem to remember that from Central days&#8230;) that can be inserted in a webpage and does most of the detection work for you.<\/p>\n<p>Another security feature that Adobe have introduced is the technique of signing an AIR application.

And apparently, worse case scenario doesn\u2019t just include the usual suspects \u2013 like funding for the project running out \u2013 but a black hole being created and swallowing the earth.\n\nI do love it what the media latches onto scientific events such as these, because they consistently feel duty bound to simplify things to the point where they no longer make sense. I mean \u2013 liking the supercollider to \u201cAn enormous microscope\u201d? Right, that\u2019s a perfect analogy, if you imagine a microscope working by smashing thing with an enormous hammer and then classifying the resulting bits by how far they flew.\n\nScientists conducting the experiment are essentially looking for something that hasn\u2019t yet been observed in the Standard Model (the current accepted wisdom of particles physicists) \u2013 the [Higgs Boson](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Higgs_boson). So because they don\u2019t know exactly what it will be, anything could happen, right?\n\nI do have some sympathy for critics to this event. The Standard Model is a terrible theory \u2013 not because of it\u2019s accuracy or predictive power (which has been very good thus far), but because of it\u2019s seemingly lunatic-assembled rules and definitions \u2013 which sit together like some sort of ugly tangled web. If beauty is indeed truth, then we could safely assume that the theory presented in particle physics today is complete tosh, which might be why they\u2019re having trouble finding the last few bits in experimental results\u2026\n\nBut my sympathy quickly evaporates when you actually look at the postulated dangers from the scientists against the LHC (who are at present frantically [filing lawsuits](http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/worldnews\/europe\/2650665\/Legal-bid-to-stop-CERN-atom-smasher-from-destroying-the-world.html) to try and delay it\u2019s switching on). First off is the theory that [micro-black holes](http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/worldnews\/europe\/2650665\/Legal-bid-to-stop-CERN-atom-smasher-from-destroying-the-world.html) could form and slowly eat the earth over a period of 4 years. This completely ignores the widely held belief that exactly the same kind of collisions are produced on the earth naturally, and even if micro black holes were formed, they cannot be surviving otherwise we\u2019d already know. Second is the theory that the 120 tons of superfluid Helium II (used as coolant in the LHC\u2019s superconducting magnets) could explode in a [bosenova](http:\/\/bigsciencenews.blogspot.com\/2008\/07\/superfluids-becs-and-bosenovas-ultimate.html) which would essentially be like an enormous thermonuclear detonation, but presumably with latin beats. These events are described as \u201cinexplicable phenomenon\u201d, which is not exactly hard evidence that one will be formed here. I mean, is there anything we know the LHC *won\u2019t* do?\n\nSadly, i feel the media frenzy surrounding the fear of the unknown will quickly evaoprate once the damn thing actually goes online. And that\u2019s a pity, because modern-day scientific discoveries do seem to suffer from a media blackout. For example, can you remember who won the Nobel prize for physics last year? Or in the last 10? Here\u2019s hoping future LHC discoveries have a public interest that last a bit longer than a decaying Higgs Boson\u2026\n\n***** Update *****\n\nHooray! we\u2019re still here! Although now CERN tell us they haven\u2019t actually started smashing protons yet \u2013 and that won\u2019t happen for another 2 months while things are calibrated. Doh!

So it is time to start dipping into the new features available, and demo some of what\u2019s on offer.\n\nOne of the biggest new features in 2.2 is triangle caching. This is a way to speed up scenes with static cameras, and (some) static content. The [demo](http:\/\/www.infiniteturtles.co.uk\/projects\/away3d\/demos\/SierpinskiTurtles\/SierpinskiTurtles.html) above shows how Away3d can now handle around 50,000 polys rendered to screen without too much hassle, while maintaining interactivity and framerate. This is accomplished by automatically detecting when a triangle mesh require redrawing, and skipping that step when it isn\u2019t required.\n\nYou can view the turtles from any angle, but in order to maintain framerates while moving around, a wireframe model is swapped in from the point the camera starts moving. Once things are static again, triangle caching automatically kicks in. The beauty of this feature is that it will work on your existing Away3d applications without any modifications \u2013 if triangle caching can be employed, Away3d will use it!\n\nSource code is available [here](http:\/\/www.infiniteturtles.co.uk\/projects\/away3d\/demos\/SierpinskiTurtles\/srcview\/index.html), or in the right-click menu of the demo. The use of ownCanvas in the source is something to note \u2013 it essentially allows boundaries to be defined for different areas of caching in a scene. When an object has it\u2019s own drawing canvas with ownCanvas enabled, it has it\u2019s own caching routine that updates separately to other areas of the scene. So if you have a definite separation between objects that are static and objects that move (or in this case have their materials updated), enabling ownCanvas on a moving object will ensure only that container has a redraw triggered, allowing the rest of the scene to remain cached and keeping framerates high.\n\nMore demos of the new features of Away3d 2.2 should be arriving here soon.

Better late than never etc.\n\nI really felt like I needed to put something up on the conference, because this year\u2019s felt like a completely new level. We had cool video intros, cooler hotel room interiors, slick evening inspired sessions and a pub venue for the first night\u2019s mixer that didn\u2019t completely suck! Plus the usual dome theatre venue which is a beautiful space in which to soak up the collective knowledge of what was a stellar speaker lineup.\n\n![](http:\/\/www.infiniteturtles.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/10\/fotb08_02.jpg \"fotb08_02\")\n\nI really tried hard to prepare a lot of my talk in advance this time, but as usual, many things were left undone (despite a frantic code marathon on the train journey down) so a fair amount of the initial stages of the conference were spent inside a hotel room. This was in part thanks to the new version of Away3d released the day before, the usual frightening emails reporting errors started coming through a few hours after i arrived in brighton which didn\u2019t help my composure or coffee consumption.

There were a few special highlights for me \u2013 the first being [James Paterson](http:\/\/presstube.com) talking about, well, himself, on the first day\u2019s \u2018inspired\u2019 session. James delivered the entire presentation as someone might their holiday snaps, adding an extra level of surrealism to the proceedings. I especially liked the Mr. Sub commercials, not just for their content but in the gleeful way James described the horrified reaction of the company execs after receiving the first two shorts. I\u2019m delighted to say the entire series of commercials can be found on [Youtube](http:\/\/uk.youtube.com\/user\/Proboscis75) if you feel like reliving the lunacy. Another big hit for me was the [sonic wire sculpture](http:\/\/www.pitaru.com\/sonicWireSculptor\/framed\/) (actually the work of his occasional co-conspirator [Amit Pitaru](http:\/\/www.pitaru.com\/)) and a very interesting looking 3d drawing tool called Rhonda that James had used in his usual style to draw hundred of characters with varying degrees of boob appendages. Like i said, inspirational.\n\n![](http:\/\/www.infiniteturtles.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/10\/fotb08_05.jpg \"fotb08_05\")\n\nThe second standout presentation for me had to be The Robert Hodgin and his <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">Magnetoshpere demos<\/span> ITunes 8.0 visualiser. Congrats are in order, but Robert being the modest kind of guy that he is almost seemed embarassed by this recent success.

His latest visuals are something quite different it seems, being a collaborative effort for a music festival whose names escapes me, assisted by a hardcore 3d coder friend of his whose name also escapes me.

Johnathan managed 90% of his talk with the calm measured and highly effective approach seen in many of his past works \u2013 including [Wordcount](http:\/\/www.wordcount.org\/), [10\u00d710](http:\/\/tenbyten.org\/10x10.html), [We Feel Fine](http:\/\/www.wefeelfine.org\/) and [The Whalehunt](http:\/\/thewhalehunt.org\/). All of Jonathan\u2019s work seems to incorporate some deeper analysis to a collection of data that occasionally reveals unexpected results, while maintaining a human connection to the subject matter. Clever stuff I have to admit.\n\nHowever, that last 10% of the presentation was where all the trouble started. Johnathan seems to be labouring under the misapprehension that designers and coders are all empathic artists who have just lost their way. Wrong. A typical web creative is someone who does what they do because they enjoy it. There is no drive to create masterpieces, which is why none are being created.\n\nI guess Jonathan\u2019s point was really to try and address this situation \u2013 try to encourage thinking on a grander scale. However, it may still be a little too soon for this \u2013 these days the majority of creatives at the most senior level of web companies (and therefore the ones with the power to take a different direction with their work) are the ones who were part of the whole dot com boom of the mid-nineties. Is anyone really trying to suggest that these people need to have their inner artist cajoled out of them? He might as well have delivered his speech to a room full of bankers. Rather than encouraging deeper thought, Johnathan has inspired an endless discussion on how he came across as someone who is out of touch with what it means to work in the web industry today.\n\n![](http:\/\/www.infiniteturtles.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/10\/fotb08_07.jpg \"fotb08_07\")So to end, I suppose I should mention a little of my own presentation and how it went. The majority of content showcased can be found elsewhere on this blog and [away3d.com](http:\/\/away3d.com), so no slides I\u2019m afraid. The nicest surprise was getting to what i thought would be a graveyard shift at 9.00am on the final day to find a full room of expectant faces, so thanx to all who attended \u2013 you did a better job of dragging yourselves out of bed than I ever would!\n\nSadly, I still get the feeling Away3d is a rubix sphere in a world of cubes. Slightly missunderstood, and seldom seen. However, once discovered you wonder why you\u2019d never heard of it before!

I only have two memories of being out in sunlight: traveling to my new hotel on the second day (I had an unfortunate case of missing hotel when I initially arrived, which meant a hurried and slightly botched arrangement with a few other hotels at very short notice and great expense), and my taxi ride back to the airport, where I was actually trying to sleep off the night before but kept getting woken up by the charming city center motorists ![;)](http:\/\/www.infiniteturtles.co.uk\/blog\/wp-includes\/images\/smilies\/icon_wink.gif)\n\nStill, once inside the dimly lit and slightly tradesman-like entrance, the venue was an immense spectacle of Max banners and video screens, with the main auditorium one of the largest I\u2019d ever seen at a Flash conference (Of course, someone had to point out that the American one was waaaay bigger..)\n\n![](http:\/\/www.infiniteturtles.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/12\/max_keynote.jpg \"max_keynote\")\n\nTruth be told, I didn\u2019t get a huge amount of time to see presentations, as the first day was largely spent sorting out hotel arrangements, the second preparing my talk, and the third socialising with the group of 3d flashers formed after our Birds of a Feather panel on the first day. We had an interesting mix of engines on the panel (Alex and Anton from [Alternativa3D](http:\/\/blog.alternativaplatform.com\/), myself from [Away3D](http:\/\/www.away3d.com), and Carlos from [Papervision3D](http:\/\/blog.papervision3d.org\/)), which I have to say turned into a fantastic discussion that continued with an impromptu 3d Flash dinner later that evening, along with a few enthusiastic attendees!\n\n![](http:\/\/www.infiniteturtles.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/12\/max08_bofpanel.jpg \"max08_bofpanel\")[  \n](http:\/\/www.infiniteturtles.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/12\/max08_bofpanel.jpg)\n\nI\u2019d never met the Alternativa guys before, but they were great company and have the same dry sense of humour that Russians seems to share with Brits these days.. although I\u2019m not sure where that comes from \u2013 maybe it\u2019s the shared outlook of not taking life too seriously following the history of a failed empire\u2026 who knows?\n\n![](http:\/\/www.infiniteturtles.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/12\/flashing_icecube.jpg \"flashing_icecube\")\n\nThe end of the second day held witness to the obligatory Max par-tay, which had a distinctly average feel to it \u2013 a style that only large corporate companies seem to be able to pull off. When the beer ran out I feared the worst, but to their credit the organisers had an ace up their sleeve\u2026 give everyone extremely alcoholic cocktails with mysterious flashing ice cubes.\n\nStrangely, a new game started to break out, replacing the previous one of who could go without a wee the longest before having to face the mile long queue for the gents: who could pocket the most flashing cubes?

Makes me think we have a little catching up to do\u2026\n\n\u2026And then of course, it was my turn. I may have slightly overdone it with the gadgets on this occasion, but in the end most things worked (sadly, my wiimote batteries didn\u2019t!). The impression I wanted to get across with the session was how Away3d can apply itself to many different tasks, and how the framework has matured to offer a lot of useful, time saving features for generating 3d content in the Flash Player.\n\nI\u2019ve managed to upload the entire session for anyone who didn\u2019t make it, which you can access from [here](http:\/\/infiniteturtles.co.uk\/presentations\/MaxEurope2008_FindingAway3d\/Finding_Away3d.html).

[Simo](http:\/\/www.simppa.fi\/blog\/?page_id=8) is someone that has great claims to geek-worship \u2013 being one of the awesome team that make up [evoflash](http:\/\/evo.bombsquad.org\/) and having a hand in their latest [Severity Of Grey](http:\/\/evo.bombsquad.org\/sog\/) demo, while also progressing with some amazing 3D and particle demos in recent blog posts.\n\nThe [latest post](http:\/\/www.simppa.fi\/blog\/?p=534) is about sorting in AS3, and specifically, z-sorting objects that are being drawn in a 3D scene. Having done a fair amount of research on the topic myself while putting together [Away3D Lite](http:\/\/away3d.com\/away3d-lite-v1-0-fastest-and-smallest-3d-engine-in-flash), I was very interested in seeing an adapted Insertion Sort method that had essentially been laid down gauntlet-style as \u2018The fastest way to z-sort and handle objects in AS3\u2032. How could i resist? ![:)](http:\/\/www.infiniteturtles.co.uk\/blog\/wp-includes\/images\/smilies\/icon_smile.gif)\n\nA sorting algorithm in its most basic form is a function for sorting a list of objects by ordering them in the ascending or descending order of a specified property. When dealing with 3D in Flash, sorting can become one of the most processor intensive operations because it isn\u2019t done by default. Flash happens to have its own sorting functions for Arrays and Vectors, but by and large these aren\u2019t that fast, so coding something faster in AS3 is a realistic proposition. The question is, which algorithm do you use?\n\nIf you feel like you\u2019ve missed the sorting-algo boat then fear not! Wikipedia will give you a good grounding in various methods for [sorting lists](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sorting_algorithm). The [Insertion Sort](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Insertion_sort) method mentioned above is one with a simple premise \u2013 start with your unsorted list, create a new empty list, iterate through your unsorted list copying each item to its correct sorted position in your new list using an iterative compare on items already placed in the new list.\n\nIn standard use insertion sort is a fairly unimpressive algorithm. But combined with a little coding magic, Simo has transformed it into something that [appears to beat all others](http:\/\/www.simppa.fi\/experimental\/as3\/2009\/zsorts\/jedivoodoo.swf). The success of his approach is based on two simple assertions:\n\n1) Linked lists are faster than vectors when inserting values\n\n2) In most cases in a 3D engine, sorting is performed on a list that is close to already being sorted\n\nI\u2019m a little skeptical about the second point, because the modified Insertion Sort method is heavily influenced by how unsorted a list is to start with. I would agree that if the order of 3D objects in a view are saved on each frame then it could be considered that from one frame to the next, the order of objects doesn\u2019t change dramatically. However, this should be considered the most trivial case when rendering. Times when this is not the case include when objects are moving in the scene, when objects are being added or deleted from the scene, or when objects are moving in and out of view. For an unsorted list, standard Insertion Sort has one of the slowest performance records of any sorting algorithm, with a worst case of *n*<sup>2<\/sup> iterations.\n\nWith the stage now set, I offer a potential challenger to the modified Insertion Sort method! It is the method that [Away3D Lite](http:\/\/away3d.com\/away3d-lite-v1-0-fastest-and-smallest-3d-engine-in-flash) uses as its default sorting algorithm, and is know as [Radix Sorting](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Radix_sort). The biggest advantage with this algorithm is its consistent performance and minimal iterative approach. In all cases, whether sorting a completely sorted or completely unsorted list, the number of iterations required is constant at* 2n*.\n\nRadix Sorting works by taking advantage of the binary nature of numbers stored in a computer program. These numbers can be easily quantised (split into smaller numbers representing the bytes that makeup the value of the original number), and this quantisation allows numbers to be sorted incredibly efficiently. Rather that compare absolute values of numbers, objects in a list are stored in \u2018buckets\u2019 that represent a single value of the quantised state of a number. Once all numbers have been placed in their respective bucket, the result can be read out in the correctly sorted order for that quantisation by simply emptying the buckets in sequence.\n\nIn general use, Radix Sorting quantises numbers into 8-bit bytes. This means that each iteration sorts the objects into their 8-bit bucket positions for that byte (starting with the byte representing 0x00 \u2013 0xFF, then the byte representing 0x00FF \u2013 0xFFFF, then 0x00FFFF \u2013 0xFFFFFF etc.). Because we are sorting 8-bit numbers, 256 buckets are required for each iteration, to provide a bucket for each possible value. With each byte, only one iteration is required to completely sort the objects into their buckets, and read them out in the correct order. So the quoted number above for * 2n *iterations will allow you to completely sort 16-bit numbers. For 3D in Flash, this appears sufficiently accurate as long as the inverse of z is used for the sorting value.\n\nOne of the disadvantages of Radix Sorting is that it only sorts using integers. Because we currently have no byte access to floating point numbers in AS3 [(boo Adobe!](https:\/\/bugs.adobe.com\/jira\/browse\/FP-487)), z values have to be type-converted to integers on every frame, which is a little annoying as it sucks some of the power out of the algorithm. But despite this, the results are still very impressive, as [this example shows](http:\/\/www.infiniteturtles.co.uk\/projects\/speedtests\/ZSortTest\/ZSortTest.html) (using the [same source structure](http:\/\/www.infiniteturtles.co.uk\/projects\/speedtests\/ZSortTest\/srcview\/index.html) as Simo\u2019s original demonstration for comparison).\n\nHere are the results i get when directly comparing the two sorting mechanisms \u2013 in each case the list in question is 100000 items long.\n\n- Simo Insertion Sort (on sorted list) \u2013 4 ms\n- Radix Sort (on sorted list) \u2013 16 ms\n- Simo Insertion Sort (on extremely unsorted list) \u2013 ????\n- Radix Sort (on extremely unsorted list) -16 ms\n\nThe default for the ZSortTest demo is to create an already sorted list, which gives an Insertion Sort result of 4ms. Simo doesn\u2019t bother to test an unsorted list in his post, and i think i may know why\u2026. Flash Player times out before you get a result! ![;)](http:\/\/www.infiniteturtles.co.uk\/blog\/wp-includes\/images\/smilies\/icon_wink.gif) His suggestion here is that you use a different sort method when you know a set of objects will be extremely unsorted, but this also implies that in the cases where you are using the algorithm on almost sorted lists, you will still not hit the 4ms benchmark seen here.\n\nRadix Sort on the other hand doesn\u2019t give two hoots what the starting sort nature of the list is, so it is the more consistent sort mechanism, and possibly the most consistent of any.\n\nPicking up on an earlier point on linked lists, I had a crack at improving the Radix Sort score by using linked lists rather than vectors, but bizarrely came out with a slower benchmark score of around 20 ms. This may have something to do with the difference in access speed between bucket vectors containing integers and bucket vectors containing objects. You can try it for yourself with the [source code](http:\/\/www.infiniteturtles.co.uk\/projects\/speedtests\/ZSortTest\/srcview\/index.html) \u2013 both types are present and it is a simple matter to comment out one type and uncomment the other.\n\nRegardless, all of these methods come out far faster than the closest native sorting method in Flash \u2013 the Vector.sortOn() method \u2013 which managed a woeful 54 ms in the same test.\n\n\n","html":"<p>U<a href=\"http:\/\/www.infiniteturtles.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/12\/number_sorting.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-524\" title=\"number_sorting\" src=\"http:\/\/www.infiniteturtles.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/12\/number_sorting.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"660\" height=\"440\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>A blog article recently caught my eye over at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simppa.fi\/blog\">http:\/\/www.simppa.fi<\/a> on z-sorting that i simply couldn&#8217;t resist to pick up on. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simppa.fi\/blog\/?page_id=8\">Simo<\/a> is someone that has great claims to geek-worship &#8211; being one of the awesome team that make up <a href=\"http:\/\/evo.bombsquad.org\/\">evoflash<\/a> and having a hand in their latest <a href=\"http:\/\/evo.bombsquad.org\/sog\/\">Severity Of Grey<\/a> demo, while also progressing with some amazing 3D and particle demos in recent blog posts.<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simppa.fi\/blog\/?p=534\">latest post<\/a> is about sorting in AS3, and specifically, z-sorting objects that are being drawn in a 3D scene.

The show tracks the highs and lows of the Swann family as they try to make it as a band, and the recently launched online story continues the narrative with a series of minigames based around the children of the family as they attempt to form a breakaway group and win the local battle of the bands tournament.\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.infiniteturtles.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/05\/maaf_02.jpg \"maaf_02\")](http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/cbbc\/myalmostfamousfamily\/)\n\nThe entire game is located in a 3D \u2018map\u2019 of events as they unfold, with various mishaps and discoveries along the way unlocking new content. The user is drawn into the narrative with a clever use of webcam video of the band seen as if they were communicating directly with you, and it is here where the main story unfolds. Each event is punctuated by either a video clip or minigame, with the latter requiring the user to perform a task that allows the story to advance to the next stage.\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.infiniteturtles.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/05\/maaf_03.jpg \"maaf_03\")](http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/cbbc\/myalmostfamousfamily\/)\n\nEach minigame can be completed fairly easily so that no one game is a barrier to progressing through the story, however for those who like a more competitive edge, results and highscores are logged and users can revisit a game at any stage to try and improve on their personal best. There are also some nice touches in the story where the results of your completed tasks are used directly with the narrative.\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.infiniteturtles.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/05\/maaf_04.jpg \"maaf_04\")](http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/cbbc\/myalmostfamousfamily\/)\n\nAway Media\u2019s role in the project was primarily the development of the global navigation and game shell, with the 3D map using a mixture of Away3D Lite and native Flash 3D.

The show tracks the highs and lows of the Swann family as they try to make it as a band, and the recently launched online story continues the narrative with a series of minigames based around the children of the family as they attempt to form a breakaway group and win the local battle of the bands tournament.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/cbbc\/myalmostfamousfamily\/\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-593\" title=\"maaf_02\" src=\"http:\/\/www.infiniteturtles.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/05\/maaf_02.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"660\" height=\"335\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The entire game is located in a 3D &#8216;map&#8217; of events as they unfold, with various mishaps and discoveries along the way unlocking new content. The user is drawn into the narrative with a clever use of webcam video of the band seen as if they were communicating directly with you, and it is here where the main story unfolds. Each event is punctuated by either a video clip or minigame, with the latter requiring the user to perform a task that allows the story to advance to the next stage.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/cbbc\/myalmostfamousfamily\/\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-594\" title=\"maaf_03\" src=\"http:\/\/www.infiniteturtles.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/05\/maaf_03.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"660\" height=\"335\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Each minigame can be completed fairly easily so that no one game is a barrier to progressing through the story, however for those who like a more competitive edge, results and highscores are logged and users can revisit a game at any stage to try and improve on their personal best. There are also some nice touches in the story where the results of your completed tasks are used directly with the narrative.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/cbbc\/myalmostfamousfamily\/\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-595\" title=\"maaf_04\" src=\"http:\/\/www.infiniteturtles.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/05\/maaf_04.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"660\" height=\"335\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Away Media&#8217;s role in the project was primarily the development of the global navigation and game shell, with the 3D map using a mixture of Away3D Lite and native Flash 3D.

Performance has improved also, and we expect framerates to increase still further as we continue to optimise the new framework. There have been some older class replacements that you need to be aware of when upgrading: both custom classes MatrixAway3D and Number3D have been replaced by the native Matrix3D and Vector3D classes respectively for added speed and stability.\n\n[![battlecell_04](http:\/\/www.infiniteturtles.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/battlecell_04.jpg \"battlecell_04\")](http:\/\/influxis.com\/battlecell\/)\n\nThe Battlecell demo is kindly hosted by Influxis and can be accessed online at [http:\/\/www.influxis.com\/battlecell](http:\/\/www.influxis.com\/battlecell). Type in a room name for your friends to join, and a user name so that others can identify you in-game. The game URL can easily be copy-pasted for fast access to a room, and any user leaving the game automatically frees-up their slot for a new user to join. As the APIs are still being tested, a maximum of 4 users can join a single room at once, but we hope to increase this limit in future versions of the demo.\n\nAs usual, all updates can be downloaded from the [googlecode svn](http:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/away3d\/), or from the [downloads](http:\/\/away3d.com\/wp-admin\/away3d.com\/downloads) section of away3d.com.\u00c2\u00a0 For those of you just interested in upgrading your FP10 library without having to worry about existing code breaking, there is a [specially tagged 3.5.2 version](http:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/away3d\/source\/browse\/#svn\/tags\/3.5.2%20lib) of the code that includes all enhancements up to the point where external API adjustments are made. This version is recommended for developers in the middle of a project, who don\u2019t want the hassle of changing their code. A full breakdown of the API changes for 3.6.0 will be posted on the [Away3D mailing list](http:\/\/groups.google.com\/group\/away3d-dev?pli=1) in the next few days.\n\n\n","html":"<p>Last week the latest Away3D release was launched &#8211; the FP10-only 3.6.0 version which added some much needed memory and speed optimisations to the main branch of the engine.

Obstacles in  the game include lifts, teleport windows, acid baths and secret tunnels  to assist your attacks&#8230; but be careful who is lurking round the  corner!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/influxis.com\/battlecell\/\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-520\" title=\"battlecell_03\" src=\"http:\/\/www.infiniteturtles.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/battlecell_03.jpg\" alt=\"battlecell_03\" width=\"660\" height=\"452\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The new 3.6.0 version of Away3D has a completely remodeled core to  take full advantage of all native 3D APIs in Flash 10, which results in  more stable and less memory-hungry apps. Performance has improved also,  and we expect framerates to increase still further as we continue to  optimise the new framework. There have been some older class  replacements that you need to be aware of when upgrading: both custom  classes MatrixAway3D and Number3D have been replaced by the native  Matrix3D and Vector3D classes respectively for added speed and  stability.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/influxis.com\/battlecell\/\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-519\" title=\"battlecell_04\" src=\"http:\/\/www.infiniteturtles.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/battlecell_04.jpg\" alt=\"battlecell_04\" width=\"660\" height=\"452\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The Battlecell demo is kindly hosted by Influxis and can be accessed online at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.influxis.com\/battlecell\">http:\/\/www.influxis.com\/battlecell<\/a>.  Type in a room name for your friends to join, and a user name so that  others can identify you in-game. The game URL can easily be copy-pasted  for fast access to a room, and any user leaving the game automatically  frees-up their slot for a new user to join. As the APIs are still being  tested, a maximum of 4 users can join a single room at once, but we hope  to increase this limit in future versions of the demo.<\/p>\n<p>As usual, all updates can be downloaded from the <a href=\"http:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/away3d\/\">googlecode svn<\/a>, or from the <a href=\"http:\/\/away3d.com\/wp-admin\/away3d.com\/downloads\">downloads<\/a> section of away3d.com.\u00c2\u00a0 For those of you just interested in upgrading your FP10 library without having to worry about existing code breaking, there is a <a href=\"http:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/away3d\/source\/browse\/#svn\/tags\/3.5.2%20lib\">specially tagged 3.5.2 version<\/a> of the code that includes all enhancements up to the point where external API adjustments are made. This version is recommended for developers in the middle of a project, who don&#8217;t want the hassle of changing their code. A full breakdown of the API changes for 3.6.0 will be posted on the <a href=\"http:\/\/groups.google.com\/group\/away3d-dev?pli=1\">Away3D mailing list<\/a> in the next few days.<\/p>\n","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":2,"created_at":"Wed, 06 Oct 2010 06:24:31 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Fri, 15 Oct 2010 15:02:40 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Wed, 06 Oct 2010 06:24:31 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":751,"title":"Away3D at Max 2010","slug":"away3d-at-max-2010","markdown":"\n[![](http:\/\/www.infiniteturtles.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/Adobe-CS5-max.jpg \"Adobe-CS5-max\")](http:\/\/max.adobe.com\/)\n\nMyself and the Away3D team are currently beavering away on the final preparations for our presentation at Max \u2013 this will be without a doubt one of the biggest events of the year and we feel extremely privileged to be a part of it.

As this was my second time presenting [Simulating the Real](..\/fitc-presentation-simulating-the-real), i actually had a chance to see some of the other presentations and take in a bit of conference atmosphere in place of the usual mad rush to finish slides.\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.infiniteturtles.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/05\/IMG_1466.jpg \"IMG_1466\")](http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/37936759@N00\/5753129040\/in\/set-72157626791475546\/)The conference venue itself was a divvied-up nightclub with a rabbit-warren of corridors and rooms and some fairly impressive looking murals & decor on the walls. It did feel quite cocooned from the outside world, which was no bad thing considering the outside world for the duration of the conference decided to do a very good impression of a typical British summer. The slightly gaudy surroundings if anything added to the feeling of detachment, and once inside the WiFi did its bit to assist with a sporadic connection speed. But in many ways this didn\u2019t really matter, and I was more than cheered up by the goodies we got on arrival which included a selection of sweets you could actually eat! I can\u2019t remember the last time I had a candy necklace\u2026\n\nAs a kick-off to the event, we were treated to the now legendary MK12 opening titles sequence, which used a 50\u2019s drive-in theater style to get across some kind of unholy underlying pop-corn themed blood-lust. Well that was my interpretation anyway \u2013 make you own judgment below.\n\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"371\" src=\"http:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/23350537?title=1&byline=1&portrait=1\" width=\"660\"><\/iframe>(note to vimeo \u2013 stop making your movie player so hard to embed in wordpress blogs!)\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.infiniteturtles.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/05\/IMG_1475.jpg \"IMG_1475\")](http:\/\/www.infiniteturtles.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/05\/IMG_1475.jpg)The first presentation i saw was [Veronique Brossier\u2019s Video Tapestry](http:\/\/www.fitc.ca\/events\/presentations\/presentation.cfm?event=116&presentation_id=1470) \u2013 the application of which i had first witnessed at Adobe Max last year. It focuses on the idea that a video timeline control can take on key images of the points in the film they represent, and i really hope we end up seeing this in some sort of Adobe component in future as the resulting application provides a much more intuitive navigation method than traditional controls. Rather than sticking to a standard film-strip of screenshots, the tapestry approach allows blending between images to create a seamless transition between scenes, adding to the overall appeal. Another trick is to allow for realtime temporal zooming, which looks frankly amazing the first time you see it. Veronique is author of the recently published book [Developing Android Applications with Adobe AIR](http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Developing-Android-Applications-Adobe-AIR\/dp\/1449394825\/ref=sr_1_5?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1299086165&sr=1-5), and the finale in her talk was a demonstration of the video tapestry application running seamlessly in AIR on a Samsung Galaxy Tab. You can view more on the Video Tapestry effect by watching this [Adobe Labs Video](http:\/\/www.adobe.com\/technology\/graphics\/video_tapestries.html) that summarises the key ingredients of the technology.\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.infiniteturtles.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/05\/IMG_1480.jpg \"IMG_1480\")](http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/37936759@N00\/5753135360\/in\/set-72157626791475546\/)Next was the Adobe Keynote, which this year has been uploaded to Adobe TV and can be veiwed in its entirety [here](http:\/\/tv.adobe.com\/watch\/fitc\/fitc-toronto-2011-adobe-keynote-by-david-wadhwani\/). Things kicked off with David Wadhwani talking about Flash\u2019s past & present covering fairly run-of-the-mill ground (ie.

It did feel quite cocooned from the outside world, which was no bad thing considering the outside world for the duration of the conference decided to do a very good impression of a typical British summer. The slightly gaudy surroundings if anything added to the feeling of detachment, and once inside the WiFi did its bit to assist with a sporadic connection speed. But in many ways this didn&#8217;t really matter, and I was more than cheered up by the goodies we got on arrival which included a selection of sweets you could actually eat! I can&#8217;t remember the last time I had a candy necklace&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>As a kick-off to the event, we were treated to the now legendary MK12 opening titles sequence, which used a 50&#8217;s drive-in theater style to get across some kind of unholy underlying pop-corn themed blood-lust.

It focuses on the idea that a video timeline control can take on key images of the points in the film they represent, and i really hope we end up seeing this in some sort of Adobe component in future as the resulting application provides a much more intuitive navigation method than traditional controls. Rather than sticking to a standard film-strip of screenshots, the tapestry approach allows blending between images to create a seamless transition between scenes, adding to the overall appeal. Another trick is to allow for realtime temporal zooming, which looks frankly amazing the first time you see it. Veronique is author of the recently published book <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Developing-Android-Applications-Adobe-AIR\/dp\/1449394825\/ref=sr_1_5?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1299086165&amp;sr=1-5\">Developing Android Applications with Adobe AIR<\/a>, and the finale in her talk was a demonstration of the video tapestry application running seamlessly in AIR on a Samsung Galaxy Tab.

For me. I know some of you are workaholics, but sadly I only ever seem to collect addictions that are bad for me.\n\nHowever, as I try not to look those deadlines too squarely in the face, I can be somewhat comforted by the fact that there is currently quite a lot worth talking about. Firstly there is the ever approaching Away3D 4.0 gold release which we are hoping to occur some time towards the end of the month, as well as new development on Away Physics and analysis on how the Adobe premium license (or \u201cspeed tax\u201d as it is more affectionately known) will affect us here. Then there is Prefab 2.0 which is getting closer to a release as well although [Fabrice](http:\/\/www.closier.nl\/blog\/) won\u2019t give too much away on an exact date as yet \u2013 expect more information soon enough.\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.infiniteturtles.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/flash_gamm_2012.jpg \"flash_gamm_2012\")](http:\/\/www.flashgamm.com\/moscow2012\/en\/)\n\nFirst event on May 17th will be the exotic looking [FlashGamm!](http:\/\/www.flashgamm.com\/moscow2012\/en\/) conference in Moscow \u2013 a day long game developers festival based around Flash, social and mobile (like it says above. What do you mean you can\u2019t read?). Having met a few Russian devs at previous conferences around the world I\u2019m fairly confident their a friendly, outgoing bunch but the country itself is something I\u2019ve not experienced before.

Things kick off on the 15th May at the <a href=\"http:\/\/devgamm.com\/moscow2014\/en\/attend\/venue\/\">Radisson Blu in central Moscow<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.multi-mania.be\/\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1154\" title=\"multi_mania-2014\" src=\"http:\/\/www.infiniteturtles.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/multi_mania-2014.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"660\" height=\"375\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Afterwards, I&#8217;ll be railing-it down to Belgium for\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.multi-mania.be\/\">Multi Mania<\/a> in Kortrijk. This is a <strong>free<\/strong> conference, and always confounds expectation by also being one of the best so no excuses for missing out! Dates are 19th &#8211; 20th May at the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/multi-mania.be\/14\/about\/the-venue\/\">Kortrijk Xpo<\/a>, with sessions from a great selection of speakers including the likes of <a href=\"http:\/\/multi-mania.be\/14\/speakers\/peter-elst\/\">Peter Elst<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/multi-mania.be\/14\/speakers\/sakri-rosenstrom\/\">Sakri Rrosenstrom<\/a> and\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/multi-mania.be\/14\/speakers\/seb-lee-delisle\/\">Seb Lee-Delisle<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>At both conferences, I&#8217;ll be talking about some of the new work we&#8217;ve been busy with in Typescript &amp; WebGL, with further info on our plans over the next few months and where we see things headed, as well as all the latest demos and perhaps even a little live coding just so that you can see how bad my typing really is. The talk is called <strong>Finding AwayJS<\/strong> which should give some hint to its contents and direction.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/away3d-typescript-workshop-tickets-11506384907\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1156\" title=\"Away3D TypeScript Workshop 660\" src=\"http:\/\/www.infiniteturtles.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/Away3D-TypeScript-Workshop-6601.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"660\" height=\"392\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Sandwiched between this, I&#8217;ll be holding a one day Typescript training workshop in Moscow on the 17th May, directly after DevGAMM. Details for this can be found on our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/away3d-typescript-workshop-tickets-11506384907\">Eventbrite page<\/a> and parallel <a href=\"http:\/\/idecide.timepad.ru\/event\/121759\/\">Timepad<\/a> page (the latter to handle local currency). The workshop will be focusing on introductory 3D development natively in the browser, and all the recent goodness we&#8217;ve been tinkering with. This is your chance to get first hand training and advice on native web 3D development, with a ton of cool examples and walkthroughs. If the <a href=\"https:\/\/plus.google.com\/u\/0\/photos\/+RostyslavSiryk\/albums\/5954278260280749601\">last Typescript training<\/a> was anything to go by, it should also be great fun.<\/p>\n<p>I can&#8217;t believe how long its been since my last post here, so I&#8217;m officially declaring this blog re-opened!

In Away3D it is possible to set the fov property of the PerspectiveLens to whatever value you feel comfortable with, but this doesn\u2019t necessarily produce the best results at very wide angles (say, above 110 degrees). One solution to this is to post-process the image sent to the view using the same projection distortions seen in a\u00a0**[fish-eye lens](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fisheye_lens)**.\n\nFish-eye lenses are all the rage in photography but you tend to see them less in 3D graphics, possibly because they aren\u2019t always the most efficient rendering technique. But when a project demands it, they are a necessary evil and worthy of some consideration. The most recent example of this has to be projection requirements for hardware like the\u00a0**[Oculus Rift](http:\/\/www.oculusvr.com\/)** where the stereoscopic view requires a certain amount of **[barrel distortion](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Distortion_(optics))** to map correctly to the optics in the headset.\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.infiniteturtles.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/fish-eye2.jpg \"fish-eye2\")](http:\/\/infiniteturtles.co.uk\/projects\/away3d4\/examples\/Advanced_TerrainDemo\/Advanced_TerrainDemo.html)\n\nIn my particular case, I was rendering a scene for projection onto a 180-degree dome \u2013 something you can see in most theme parks these days or IMAX cinemas (i was going to say \u201cplanetarium\u201d here but I only just discovered that the\u00a0[London Planetarium](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/London_Planetarium) was rebranded in 2006 and now hosts something called the \u201cMarvel Superheroes 4D attraction\u201d \u2013 so boo to them for making me feel old!). Essentially the screen is made up of several overlapping projectors that feed off a single master image of the projection called a **[Domemaster](http:\/\/stardust.ringling.edu\/cosmix\/fulldome\/domemaster\/domemaster.html)**. \u00a0It is this that any video or interactive graphic needs to display if it is to be projected correctly onto the dome, and the distortions present in the Domemaster have similar characteristics to that of a fish-eye lens.\n\nSo how to achieve the effect? There are several methods, but the one I found to give the most pleasing results involves rendering 6 planes to a Skybox, and then rendering the Skybox to the view with a bit of shader trickery. The image below shows the effect in Away3D with \u00a0debug images rendered to the skybox instead of a scene \u2013 here we have a 180-degree fov set on the shader. An optimisation trick with this approach (unless you have a very high fov)\u00a0is to move the skybox with the camera so that only 5 sides of the box are visible at any one time.\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.infiniteturtles.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/fish-eye3.jpg \"fish-eye3\")](http:\/\/infiniteturtles.co.uk\/projects\/away3d4\/examples\/Advanced_TerrainDemo\/Advanced_TerrainDemo.html)\n\nA strange thing about fish-eye lenses is the impression they give \u2013 a very stylised, immersive feel that thanks to massive overuse in fashion and pop-culture has led to a unmistakable association with cool. If you don\u2019t believe me, check out the [Away3D terrain demo with fish-eye applied](http:\/\/infiniteturtles.co.uk\/projects\/away3d4\/examples\/Advanced_TerrainDemo\/Advanced_TerrainDemo.html) \u2013 I defy you to disagree that things look instantly cooler ![;)](http:\/\/www.infiniteturtles.co.uk\/blog\/wp-includes\/images\/smilies\/icon_wink.gif)\n\n[Source code](http:\/\/infiniteturtles.co.uk\/projects\/away3d4\/examples\/Advanced_TerrainDemo\/srcview\/index.html) is available for the demo featured here, and the implementation in Away3D has been added to the [dev branch](https:\/\/github.com\/away3d\/away3d-core-fp11\/tree\/dev) on github as an additional post-processing effect.
